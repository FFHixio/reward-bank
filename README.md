## Installation

In order to run the project locally for development and testing, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install`

<br />

## Usage

The aim of Reward Bank, as stated above, is to have a starting point for children to learn how to handle money within the now more increasing digital world. Given the increase in digital transactions, with more people going cashless, Reward Bank came from wanting to find a way to teach children financial responsibility that is more reflective of how the majority of the population handles transactions.

In order to start using Reward Bank, follow the link below for the deployed website. From there, set up your account and the associated child accounts. From there, as a parent, enter in the tasks that you'd like to see your child complete along with a certain amount of points. There isn't any set rule on how much a point is worth--feel free to engage your child in the process of setting up how much they're earning from each task!

Then the part any kid will love: setting up the reward list. Like the task like, you'll be entering the rewards that you'll hand out and the amount of points each reward is worth. Look back on how much you set each of the tasks to get an idea of how much you want each reward to be worth. Assign the tasks to your child through your account and see it pop up on their end waiting to be completed.

As your child completes their tasks, they can log into their own account and mark them as completed. This then gets sent back to you as the parent to approve (or ask to recomplete) and gives your child points that they'll collect in their virtual bank. As their bank grows they can start looking at the rewards and their associated cost to see how much more they'll need to get a late bedtime, or 30 blissfully uninterrupted minutes on the TV.
